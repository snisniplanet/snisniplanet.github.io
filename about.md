# About

SNISNI is a blogging platform where you can build your own online presence, without worrying about the *boring* stuff.

## Where am I?

Hi, my name is **Mattia Sinisi**, I'm the developer behind this project.

Everything is still in development so, for now, enjoy this GitHub page.

## Who are you?

I'm a 18 y/o developer from Rome (Italy) and I'm conducting a community-building experiment with the final goal of bringing unknown talents in the world of **Web Development** to light.

If you are interested, I'm specialized in:
* JavaScript: Vanilla JS, Vue, Svelte, Next, React
* PHP: Vanilla PHP, Laravel, Lumen & everything where Taylor Otwell is involved
* C#: ASP.NET
* SQL Databases

I've also used these in previous projects:
* C++
* Java
* Ruby + Ruby On Rails
* Python + The Anaconda Bundle
* Cobol (*Just for curiosity*)
